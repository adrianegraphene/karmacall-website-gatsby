        <p>
          <br />
          KarmaCall is licensed to You (End-User) by RoboCash, Inc., Doing Business As FynCom, located at 17877 Von Karman Ave, Suite 400 Irvine, CA 92614 ,
          United States (hereinafter: Licensor), for use only under the terms of this License Agreement.
          <br />
          <br />
          By downloading the Application from the Google Play Store, and any update thereto (as permitted by this License Agreement), You indicate that You
          agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and that You accept this License Agreement.
          <br />
          <br />
          The parties of this License Agreement acknowledge that Google is not a Party to this License Agreement and is not bound by any provisions or
          obligations with regard to the Application, such as warranty, liability, maintenance and support thereof. FynCom, not Google, is solely responsible
          for the licensed Application and the content thereof.
          <br />
          <br />
          This License Agreement may not provide for usage rules for the Application that are in conflict with the latest Google Play Store Terms of Service.
          FynCom acknowledges that it had the opportunity to review said terms and this License Agreement is not conflicting with them.
          <br />
          <br />
          All rights not expressly granted to You are reserved.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>1. THE APPLICATION</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          KarmaCall (hereinafter: Application) is a piece of software created to block malicious spam calls through a financial filter that pays users. This is
          customized for Google mobile devices. It is used to block spam calls.
          <br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, it is used to Earn, deposit and withdraw <a href="https://nano.org/">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.<br />
          <br />
          While the Application follows general privacy policy standards (see our <a href="PrivacyPolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>), the Application is not
          tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
          Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Application. You may not use the
