              KarmaCall (hereinafter: Application) is a piece of software created to block malicious spam calls through a financial filter that pays users to
              ignore unknown calls. This is customized for Google and Apple mobile devices. It is used to block spam calls while allowing unknown callers to
              make refundable micro-deposits in order to authenticate themselves to you.
              <br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, it is used to Earn and withdraw <a href="https://nano.org/">Nano cryptocurrency</a> while allowing the option to cash out to gift
              cards.
