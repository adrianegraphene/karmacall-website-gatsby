            <strong>Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers,
            contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment
            processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use
            tracking technology on the Services or Apps, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services or Apps over time. This
            information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online
            activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional
            purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
            company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Advertisers.</strong> We don&#x27;t sell your data to 3rd parties and we don&#x27;t serve ads. The entire purpose of this
            venture is change the way your data is processed. Our goal is to convince 3rd parties that we would all be much better off if 3rd parties just
            directly paid you for your data, as opposed to the status quo where companies make their riches by selling your data without paying you for it. The
            KarmaCall app is the first example of how we&#x27;ll accomplish that, by ignoring any unknown calls unless they come with a deposit. By joining us,
            you are reducing the supply of phone numbers that answer unknown calls and that will increase the demand for phone numbers that do answer those
            calls. The only time third-parties will buy your data is if you set your own market rate and they agree to pay YOU that market rate through our
            platform.
